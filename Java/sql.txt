SQL starts with data types,
which define what kind of data a column can store,
such as numeric types (INT, FLOAT), string types (CHAR, VARCHAR), date/time types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP), and logical types (BOOLEAN). 
Using these data types,
DDL (Data Definition Language)
commands are applied to define and manage database structures: CREATE is used to create databases and tables, DROP permanently removes tables or databases along with their data, TRUNCATE deletes all records while keeping the table structure intact, and ALTER modifies existing tables by adding, dropping, or modifying columns.
 Once the structure is defined, DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands handle the data inside the tables: INSERT adds new rows, UPDATE modifies existing records, and DELETE removes records, all of which can be controlled using conditions and rolled back using transactions. Finally,
  DQL (Data Query Language) is used to retrieve data without modifying it, primarily through the SELECT statement, which can fetch all or specific columns, apply filters, sorting, and limits, while DISTINCT ensures that only unique records are returned. Together, data types, DDL, DML, and DQL form the core foundation of SQL for designing, managing, manipulating, and querying relational databases.
